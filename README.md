# Battleship

## Description

Classic Battleship. Try to sink your opponent's ships!

## Objectives

Sink your opponent's ships.

## Directions

1. Initialize two players, either computer or human. For each human player, enter
a name.  For each player, either computer or human, also enter the width and
height dimensions of the desired board side.  

2. Initialize the game with two players as the arguments.

3. Play will switch between players. On each player's turn, one shot may be
made at the other board. Enter a letter and a number that are within the range
of board size that was initialized. For example, if the board was initialized
with a height of 4, shots can only be made from A-D.

4. On each player's turn, two boards will be shown. First, the board that
displays the shots that player has already made. Hits are marked with a "+"
and misses are marked with a "-". The second board shows the player's own ships,
with hits marked with a "X" and un-hit ships marked with a "O".

5. Play will move back and forth until one player has sunk all ships of the
other player.
