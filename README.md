# Battle(?)ship

## Description

This program is a little game called Battleship. Well that's what it could be, but we haven't passed all of the tests in our test suite.  And thus, we don't have a working game.

We did however, pass 34 of the 41 tests.  That's not terribly shabby.  Leave us alone, we're new to this.

##Somethings we've learned
* The basics of control flow, variables, and methods in Ruby.
* The basics of Object Oriented Programming.
* The basic use cases of Git for single-developer projects.
  * We collaborated on a forked project, and never had any real issues of "Hey! Where'd that file go?"
* Using a test suite is pretty nice, because otherwise this would have been way over our heads! Oh and DEBUGGING WOULD HAVE BEEN A NIGHTMARE MODE ALL ON IT'S OWN!!!
